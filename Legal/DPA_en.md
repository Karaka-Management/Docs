# Agreement on commissioned processing

According to Art. 28 para. 3 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

## Subject matter and duration of processing

The subject matter of the agreement is the rights and obligations of the parties in the context of the provision of services in accordance with the service description and GTC, insofar as personal data is processed by Jingga e.K. (hereinafter referred to as the Contractor) as the processor for the customer as the controller (hereinafter referred to as the Client) in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR. This includes all activities that the contractor performs to fulfill the order and that constitute order processing. This also applies if the order does not expressly refer to this agreement on order processing. 

The duration of the processing depends on the actual processing of the client's personal data by the contractor.

## Type and purpose of processing

The type of processing includes all types of processing within the meaning of the GDPR to fulfill the contract.

The purposes of the processing are all purposes necessary for the provision of the contractually agreed service, in particular in the area of cloud services, hosting, software as a service (SaaS) and IT support.

## Type of personal data and categories of data subjects

The type of data processed is determined by the client through the choice of product, configuration, use of services and transmission of data.

The categories of data subjects are determined by the client through the choice of product, the configuration, the use of the services and the transmission of data.

## Responsibility and processing on documented instructions

Within the scope of this agreement, the client is solely responsible for compliance with the statutory provisions of the data protection laws, in particular for the lawfulness of data transfer to the contractor and for the lawfulness of data processing (“controller” within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR). This also applies with regard to the purposes and means of processing regulated in this agreement. 

The instructions are initially defined by the GTC and may subsequently be amended by the client in writing or in an electronic format (text form) by means of individual instructions (individual instruction). Verbal instructions must be confirmed immediately in writing or in text form. In the event of proposed changes, the Contractor shall inform the Client of the effects on the agreed services, in particular the possibility of service provision, deadlines and remuneration. If the Contractor cannot reasonably be expected to implement the instruction, the Contractor shall be entitled to terminate the processing and to terminate the contract extraordinarily. The Client's obligation to pay remuneration shall cease to apply if the Contractor discontinues the service. Unreasonableness exists in particular if the services are provided in an infrastructure that is used by several clients / customers of the Contractor (shared services) and a change in processing is not possible or not reasonable for individual clients.

The contractually agreed data processing shall take place in a member state of the European Union or in another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, unless the transfer of data to third countries is necessary for the provision of the service. In the event that a transfer to a third country takes place, the contractor shall ensure that the requirements of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR are fulfilled.

This also applies to transfers of personal data to third countries or international organizations; if there is a processing obligation contrary to an instruction, the contractor shall inform the client of the corresponding legal requirement prior to processing. Unless the law in question prohibits such information due to an important public interest. The Contractor shall inform the Client immediately if it believes that an instruction violates applicable laws.

The same applies to social secrecy, telecommunications secrecy in accordance with § 3 TTDSG and - in the knowledge of criminal liability - to the protection of secrets of persons subject to professional secrecy in accordance with § 203 StGB.
