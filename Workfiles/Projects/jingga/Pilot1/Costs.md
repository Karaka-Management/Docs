# Milestones

## Software parts

Based on the pilot candidate with whom the functionality will be implemented.

* The current costs are the annual value for the pilot candidate based on actual costs but subjectively split into more detailed cost positions (the invoices from the suppliers are not always detailed enough to differentiate between the different functions/modules).
* The future costs are costs that currently don't exist but are expected to come up in the future if the pilot candidate intends to implement **some** of the current software needs.
* The new value is an estimation of how much the newly implemented software (Karaka) will subjectively provide compared to current/future solutions. These are **NOT** the costs for the pilot candidate or cost savings. The costs for this will be discussed afterwards.
