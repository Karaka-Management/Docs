# Development Guidelines

The developer and development guidelines are published in a separate documentation called the [Developer-Guide](https://github.com/Karaka-Management/Developer-Guide). The reason for this is that also clients and third parties can modify the source code or create extensions. This documentation contains a vast amount of information which helps to understand the code structure, code standards etc.
