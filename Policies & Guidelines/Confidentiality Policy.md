Members and participants will receive and handle personal, private and confidential information about clients, suppliers, partners and our organization.

This information must be protected for two reasons:

1. Legally binding

During this process it may be required by the receiver of the confidential information to sign a non-compete and/or non-disclosure agreement (NDA).

Disclosing more information than needed must be avoided.
