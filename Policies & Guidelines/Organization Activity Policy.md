# Organization Activity Policy

Organization members are expected to do regular significant contributions to the project. 

The organization doesn't define any fixed hours and expects the members to decide on their own commitment. Long leave times of more than 3 weeks should be communicated in advance so other members can organize tasks according to this.

Members should not spend more than 40 hours per week on the organization as we believe output quality will drastically reduce over time.

Extremely few or insignificant contributions may lead to the exclusion from the organization based on judgmental basis by a senior member. A member can expect to receive a warning in advance in order to provide the chance to increase the activity or provide reasons for the past activities.
