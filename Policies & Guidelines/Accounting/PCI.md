# PCI Compliance

This PCI Compliance document is intended for our company which only uses Stripe for its credit card payments. As a payment processing service, Stripe is a PCI compliant payment gateway that can help companies securely process payments without storing sensitive payment information. However, in order to maintain PCI compliance, our company must ensure that certain practices and procedures are followed. This document outlines the steps that we take to ensure PCI compliance.

PCI Compliance:

1. We do not store cardholder data: Stripe allows with checkouts to process payments without ever having access to the cardholder data. Stripe will handle the payment processing and securely store the payment information on their servers.
2. Use secure payment methods: Stripe only with checkouts is one such method that uses secure SSL/TLS encryption to ensure the safety of cardholder data.
3. Protect sensitive data: Any sensitive data that our company collects is only accessed by authorized personnel and that data is destroyed when it is no longer needed.
4. Use a secure network: We ensure that our network is secure by using firewalls and other security measures to protect against unauthorized access.
5. Regularly update software: We regularly update our software and systems to ensure that they are secure and up-to-date with the latest security patches.
6. Conduct regular security audits: We conduct regular security audits to ensure that our systems are secure and that there are no vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers.

Conclusion:

By following these PCI compliance requirements, we can ensure that processing payments is secure and that it is in compliance with PCI standards. We regularly review and update our security policies and procedures to stay up-to-date with the latest security best practices.
