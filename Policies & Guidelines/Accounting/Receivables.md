# Receivables

## Receivables and other assets

Receivables and other assets are stated at their nominal value. All items subject to risk are written off in full individually.

## Other long-term receivables

Other long-term receivables are generally recognized at nominal value. Impairments are recorded, if write-downs are required. A reversal of impairment losses is recognized when there is an indication that the reasons for write-downs recognized in previous years are no longer present.
