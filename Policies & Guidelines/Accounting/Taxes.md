# Taxes

## Current income tax

Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods represents the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in the income statement.

## Deferred taxes

Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary or quasi-permanent differences between the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred income in the statutory accounts and their tax carrying amounts, or due to tax loss carry forwards, using the company-specific tax rates applicable at the time when such differences reverse. The amounts of any resulting tax charge or benefit are not discounted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset. The option pursuant to section 274 (1) sentence 2 HGB to recognize net deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities was not applied.

## Sales taxes

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognized net of the amount of sales tax, except:

* where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item
* in the case of receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of
  receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.
