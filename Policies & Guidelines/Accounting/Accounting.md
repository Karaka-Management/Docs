# Accounting

## Accounting Standards

The German legally binding accounting regulations must be followed (i.e. Abgabenordnung AO, Umsatysteuergesetz UStG).

### Account System

The account system follows SKR 03 (Standardkontenrahmen).

New real accounts, cost centers and cost objects can only be created by the head of finance, head of controlling or head of accounting. Additionally, automated workflows may also generate real accounts, cost centers and cost objects. Examples for such automated workflows can be updates to the account system, creation of new departments etc.

### Depreciation

Amortization periods are based on the standard depreciation amortization periods provided by the Bundesfinanzministerium.
