# Change Management

## Permissions

Permission changes are sometimes necessary if a role of an employee changes or if the employee has to take over additional tasks. Such permission requests must get approved by the respective HOD and verified by the IT department. If the change request is justified the IT department changes the permissions for the employee.

Permissions should always be defined as low as possible and only get expanded if required. The IT department can decide to reject a permission change if they consider the request inappropriate.

Potential documents to be changed are:

* [Permission List](../../Processes/IT/Permission%20List.md)

## Software

Software changes include software updates, new software or functional/feature changes. Change requests can be made by any employee but must get approved by the respective HOD. If the change request is justified the IT department performs the change in a testing environment where the employee or HOD can test the change.

The IT department can decide to reject a permission change if they consider the request inappropriate.
