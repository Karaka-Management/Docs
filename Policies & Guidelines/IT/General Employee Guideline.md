Only in very few cases shared accounts exist. Credentials for such accounts can be used by multiple employees but must also be kept confidential within that group of employees. Examples for such situations are:

* Accounts for shipping software
* Accounts for some online shops
* Accounts for IT components in meeting rooms

The responsible person for shared accounts is the respective head of department.

Only company issued hardware must be used by employees as this hardware is tested and protected with security software such as anti-virus software, firewall software etc.

The hardware handed over to the employee belongs to the company and must be handled with care. This includes preventing damages and unauthorized access. Company hardware must not be accessible to third parties and must only be used for company tasks. 

Any hardware provided by the company must be returned before leaving the company after a termination.

If additional hardware is required please make a request with the IT department.

No third party USB devices (i.e. USB storage device) must be used as they can contain malware or hardware damaging components. Only company provided USB devices must be used. If a USB storage device is necessary please request one from the IT department.

If you receive a USB storage device from a thrid party please hand it over to the IT department who can inspect the data stored on the device and send you a copy.

### Software

Only company issued software must be installed on the company hardware. The software handed over to the employee belongs to the company. Company software must not be accessible to third parties and must only be used for company tasks.
