# Onboarding: DO'S and DON'TS

## DO'S

1. Read the documentation 
2. Ask questions
3. If you see a bug, missing, incomplete or wrong documentation, fix it
4. If you have ideas for features, additional functionality etc. bring them forward for discussion
5. If you feel tired from doing a specific task try to mix it up with other tasks (e.g. do some unit tests, write some documentation, do some code formatting, ...)
6. Be respectful to others! This includes members, customers, business partners, third party developers, and in general everyone in relation to this project and organization
7. Follow the code of conduct

## DON'TS

1. Don't be late to appointments. It can happen but it shouldn't be a normal occurrence
2. Don't represent the project and organization in a bad light
