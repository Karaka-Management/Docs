Customers can still choose a different solution regardless. | No significant issues                                        | Dennis Eichhorn   | 2022-01-01     |

Solutions which cover a single aspect are available but more inconvenient to use. | No significant issues but the performance (e.g. memory usage) limits the use cases and requires parallelizing certain tasks. | Dennis Eichhorn   | 2022-01-01     |
| mPDF                                    | mPDF                                      | PDF renderer (backend)      | 0 EUR                | single purchase | low             | Alternative solutions don't provide the same level of html/css rendering capabilities. Alternatives are also available through PHPWord or tcpdf. | No significant issues.                                       | Dennis Eichhorn   | 2022-01-01     |

It is the most well established remote desktop connection tool for support purposes. Alternatives VNC solutions could work as a fall back in a worst case situation. | No significant issues.                                       | Dennis Eichhorn   | 2022-01-01     |

However, github is the most established solution which is simple to use and provides the necessary functionality. It's also possible to host alternative solutions on the company servers in a worst case situation. For Visual Studio many alternatives exist out of which some are already provided (i.e. Visual Studio Code, Sublime) | No significant issues.                                       | Dennis Eichhorn   | 2022-01-01     |
