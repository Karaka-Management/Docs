## Internal Audits

### Internal Auditors



### Audits

Every department needs to be audited once every quarter by an internal auditor who is not part of the department. The DQM organizes and controls these internal audits. The results of the internal audits must be documented by the internal auditors on the [Internal Quality Management Audit Form](./Quality%20Management/Internal%20Quality%20Management%20Audit%20Form.md).

The results of the internal audits are reviewed by the DQM and appropriate steps are taken by the DQM in case of audit findings.

## Quality Control

Quality control is performed manually and continuously. Additional quality control tasks besides the quality control activities which are directly implemented in the various processes are:

* Evaluating customer satisfaction through the support
* Manual software quality checks (ease of use, features, documentation, bug hunting, security checks, ...)
  * *in addition to the checks and controls defined in the development process*
* Analyzing bugs and features
  * open bugs, time until bugs are closed
  * open feature requests, time until feature requests are resolved

The quality management department can improve some of the *deficiencies* by themselves (i.e. documentation improvements) or create a quality control report for a specific supposed *deficiency* for further investigation in the project tasks. Some of the supposed *deficiencies* may be ruled as intended and will not require a change. This decision is made by the CTO together with the DQM.
