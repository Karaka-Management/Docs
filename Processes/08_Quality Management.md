## Internal Audits

### Internal Auditors



### Audits

Every department needs to be audited once every quarter by an internal auditor who is not part of the department. The DQM organizes and controls these internal audits. The results of the internal audits must be documented by the internal auditors on the [Internal Quality Management Audit Form](./Quality%20Management/Internal%20Quality%20Management%20Audit%20Form.md).

The results of the internal audits are reviewed by the DQM and appropriate steps are taken by the DQM in case of audit findings.
