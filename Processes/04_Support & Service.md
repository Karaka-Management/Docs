# Support & Service

Support or any other software related services are only allowed if the customer has signed the [Customer Data Protection Policy]() and the [Customer Service Agreement](). This ensures that customer data access is legally and contractually covered. The customer Customer Service Agreement regulates the responsibilities and liabilities.

## Data migration

The customer and the support employee need to define the exact goals, data structure and migration strategy before it can be executed. These definitions must be put on the offer for the customer including a cost evaluation based on the time needed to perform the data migration and the complexity of the data migration. 

Only after the binding approval by the customer the order confirmation will be created (see sales process) and then the data migration can be performed.
