# Management

| Key Objective       | Target     | Achieved |
| ------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Reach budgeted EBIT | >= XXX EUR | YES      |

## Planning

The management has to plan and layout the vision as well as the strategy for the organization. This is documented in the [Business Plan](./Management/Business%20Plan.md) and annual budget described in the [Finance](./06_Finance.md) process. 

## Organizing

### Implementation

The management has to check if the organizational structure fits the needs of the company or if changes/improvements need to be made. The company structure is defined in the [Organigram](./Organigram.md). This includes but is not limited to ensuring sufficient resources are available. Resources are checked during every meeting described in the [Information Flow](./Management/Information%20Flow.md). The management also determines how information is appropriately and effectively shared between the different employees. This is defined in the [Information Flow](./Management/Information%20Flow.md).

### Staffing

Staffing is handled primarily by the HR department. However the following aspects are handled as described below:

* Hiring
  * [HR](./05_HR.md) process
* Resource definition
  * [Budget](./06_Finance.md)
  * [Regular meetings](./Management/Information%20Flow.md) (i.e. [executive committee meeting](./Management/Executive%20Committee%20Minute%20Template.md))
* Training
  * [Training plans](./HR/Onboarding/Sample%20Training%20Plan.md)
  * [Employee evaluation](./HR/Evaluation%20Forms/Employee%20Evaluation%20Form.md)

## Leading

The leadership and responsibilities of the organization is defined in the [Organigram](./Organigram.md). Additionally, responsibilities are also defined in the processes, risk control matrices, [Document Owners](./Document%20Owners.md) and individual contracts.

## Controlling

The following controlling instruments are implemented.

* [Internal audits](./Quality%20Management/Internal%20Quality%Management%Audit%Form.md)
* [Risk Management](./COSO/Risk%20Management) and Process Risk Control Matrices
* [Whistleblower System](../Policies%20&%20Guidelines/Whistleblower%20System.md)
* Executive Committee Meeting where all key people exchange information
* [Regular meetings](./Information%20Flow.md) for information exchange
* Checklists as described in the processes
* External audits
  * Tax audits (approx. every 3-5 years)
  * Annual accounting audit
* Monthly financial reporting (e.g. cash, investments, sales, costs, deviations to budget/previous year)
* Quality control as defined in the quality management process

## Optimization

From the controlling activities optimizations arise which can be brought forward by anyone in [meetings](./Management/Information%20Flow.md) and changes can be made to the processes by the responsible persons defined in the [Document Owners](./Document%20Owners.md)
